# DISTANCE-ANGLE-METER

# Arduino Angle & Distance Meter with ADXL335 & HC-SR04

In this , we will learn about Angle & Distance Meter Using Accelerometer & Ultrasonic Sensor with Arduino. We have used ADXL335 3 axis accelerometer for measuring the angle in the 360-degree dimension. Similarly, we have used HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor to measure distance up to 400 cm. The measured angle and distance are displayed on the 16*2 I2C LCD Display.

Here we will be interfacing ADXL335 Accelerometer and Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04 with Arduino to measure the angle and distance.
